Description:
A tcp client-server tic-tac-toe game written in C++ and Qt.

Instructions to play:
1. Select single or multi-player mode
2. (Multi-player: Connect to server)
3. Start game (Multi-player: you may have to wait for your opponent)

Bugs:
* No valid-move checking in single player mode

Improvements:
* Separate client-server processes and projects
* Add feedback for live connection and game states
* add game metrics
* add perfect AI
* Add unit tests

* Multiple screens (port client window to client main window)
* Improve message/POD structures
* Rename MyTCPClient/Server (and probably compose over inherit)
