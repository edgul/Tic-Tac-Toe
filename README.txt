Description:
A tcp client-server tic-tac-toe game written in C++ and Qt.

Future Features:
* Separate client-server processes and projects
* Add feedback for live connection and game states
* add game metrics
* add perfect AI
* Add unit tests

Architecture:
* Improve message/POD structures
* Rename MyTCPClient/Server (and probably compose over inherit)

Bugs:
* Single player difficulty selections doesn't affect AI (only dumb ai right now)
* Rig up multi-player
